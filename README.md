# Mathematical-Space_Invaders
My first-ever coding project!
A game combining both skill and knowledge by randomly generating equations or numbers (depending on difficulty) and making them appear on enemies, requiring you to input the correct answer and then shoot to kill thus gaining points, failing to kill results in loss of lives. (Notice the coding difference between this and my newest Card_game project)

Skills demonstrated:
SQL Commands - sending data to a local rationalised database.
Basic OOP
Basic python code

Improvements I could make:
Increase efficiency of code 
Integrate complex concepts of OOP into code
connect to a cloud database.
